TailTheft is a scheme that leverages the wasted tail for saving energy in cellular networks. 

These codes are the simulative implementation of TailTheft in ns2, which also include implementation of other tail optimization approaches: TOP and TailEnder. 


The main codes are listed below.

ns-2.34_original-0.1.diff - patches for ns2, which include the eurane code and code wirtten by me.
ns-2.34_tailtheft-0.1.diff - patches for original to simulate tailtheft
ns-2.34_top-0.1.diff - patches for original to simulate top
ns-2.34_tailender-0.1.diff - patches for original to simulate tailender
